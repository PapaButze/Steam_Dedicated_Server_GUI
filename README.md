# Steam_Dedicated_Server_GUI
This is a simple Steam Dedicated-Server GUI fully coded with local AI

I use it for my Palworld server, but i think it can be used for much more dedicated Servers which uses RCON to communicate with the Server. 
Eventually you need to edit player count function or some others slidly to use it for your dedicated Server. 

You can run it via python or you can run it if using the .exe in dist directory. 

Windows think it is a virus, but its not!. I try to fix it, but my local ai couldnt to that.
